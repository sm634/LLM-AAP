Charges remain to be filed in their cases.\nAccording to Arabian Business, the unnamed Kenyan domestic worker began working for Alayban in Saudi Arabia in March 2012. She had been promised by a recruiting agency that she would be working standard hours for $1,600 a month for the length of a two-year contract.\nBut the woman‚Äôs passport was confiscated, and Alayban refused to return it when she complained about unpaid wages. She was temporarily given her passport to travel with Alayban and her family to the US in May.\nThe woman fled Alayban‚Äôs home on Tuesday by bus, quickly contacting the police.\nAlayban is being held on a $5 million bail and has been ordered to surrender her passport and submit to GPS monitoring, The Associated Press reported.\nIf convicted, Alayban could face up to 12 years in prison, The Guardianwrote.\nAccording to AP, Alayban‚Äôs attorney claimed that the case is one of ‚Äúwork hours dispute.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThis is not a contract dispute‚Ä¶This is holding someone captive against their will,‚Äù District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said in court during a bail hearing Wednesday.\nMigrant domestic workers are regular targets of abuse worldwide. Numerous NGOs address the issue in the Middle East, where cases of violence and exploitation of migrant workers can be common.\nA report published by the International Labor Organization (ILO) in January that only 10 percent of the reported 52 million domestic workers worldwide ‚Äì mostly women ‚Äì are covered by the same general labor laws as other workers.\nWorkers in private households often experience harsher working conditions than other workers in the same countries, the report said, and more than 25 percent are not covered by any labor legislation in their respective countries.\nBecause many migrant domestic workers have limited knowledge of the language and laws of their country of residence, they are especially vulnerable to abusive practices such as verbal, physical, and psychological abuse along with unhealthy living and working conditions.",Incident,incident
124,"A nationwide sweep to search for children who were being commercially sexually exploited found 106 juvenile victims of sex trafficking nationwide, nine of whom were recovered by efforts coordinated by the Denver division of the FBI. The enforcement action, Operation Cross Country, combined the efforts of local law enforcement, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and 47 FBI divisions, including the Denver office with the Rocky Mountain Innocence Lost Task Force described in the Boulder Weekly story ‚ÄúTracking down the trafficked,‚Äù published July 25.\n\nFBI agents spent 72 hours over the weekend of July 27 on the nationwide effort, which took place in 76 cities and led to the arrests of 152 suspected pimps.\n\n‚ÄúChild prostitution remains a persistent threat to children across America,‚Äù Ron Hosko, assistant director of the FBI‚Äôs Criminal Investigative Division, said in a press release from the FBI. ‚ÄúThis operation serves as a reminder that these abhorrent crimes can happen anywhere and the FBI remains committed to stopping this cycle of victimization and holding the criminals who profit from this exploitation accountable.‚Äù\n\nThis was the seventh Operation Cross Country organized by the FBI‚Äôs 10-year-old Innocence Lost National Initiative. The initiative‚Äôs efforts have led to the recovery of 2,700 children.\n\nThe Denver FBI office has also reported that during the operation they arrested six alleged pimps and identified 11 pimps, cited/arrested 51 adults for prostitution, arrested 25 johns and arrested six adults for other crimes, including four felonies.\n\nLocal agencies involved included police departments in Aurora, Casper, Colorado Springs, Denver, Greenwood Village, Lakewood, Pueblo and Wheat Ridge; sheriff ‚Äôs offices in Arapahoe, Douglas, Jefferson and Pueblo counties; the FBI; Homeland Security Investigations; the United States Marshals; and Wyoming Division Criminal Investigation.\n\n‚ÄúHuman trafficking is a multijurisdictional-type crime, so it requires a multijurisdictional effort against it,‚Äù Sgt. Dan Steele, a Denver Police officer who works on the FBI‚Äôs division of the Innocence Lost Task Force, told Boulder Weekly. ‚Äú[Traffickers] go to all sorts of different jurisdictions, they go interstate, they go out of country even, so that requires not only having multiple agencies involved, and not as restrictive boundaries, but also having the federal government involved to have that reach where we need it.‚Äù\n\nTask force operations often begin as local enforcement actions in truck stops, casinos, street ‚Äòtracks‚Äô and on dating or escort service websites, according to a press release from the FBI Denver office. Arrests for prostitution or solicitation can provide information on more organized, cross-state trafficking operations.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs really no one way we find these trafficking victims,‚Äù Ricky Wright, the FBI coordinator for the Rocky Mountain Safe Streets task force, told Boulder Weekly. Wright has been with the FBI 16 years and has been working on the Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force, specializing in violent crimes against children, for six years. His first work with child prostitution enforcement was on an Operation Cross Country roughly five years ago.\n\n‚ÄúA lot of times, once we think we have an idea, or any knowledge really that a girl out there might be involved in prostitution, we start looking for her, and since a lot of it‚Äôs online anymore we can try to find escort ads they might be posting,‚Äù Wright says.\n\nAn online search for Denver escorts could return dozens of such websites.\n\nFBI agents and police partner with the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs offices and the U.S. Department of Justice‚Äôs Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section to collect evidence to bring charges.\n\nBecause of the time between the initial arrest and the trial for an accused pimp or trafficker, the victims are not often available to testify.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where it‚Äôs nice to have this multijurisdictional task force where we have the time to work on proving the case beyond that reasonable doubt, even beyond having the victim,‚Äù Steele says. ‚ÄúThat means going back through and taking every little piece of information that the child or the adult gave us and corroborating every little piece of information so that basically the amount of information is so overwhelming that it puts the prosecutors in a position of power.‚Äù\n\nRespond: letters@boulderweekly.com",Incident,article

58,"Over the past year, the Singapore authorities have intensified enforcement efforts to combat human trafficking, which local human rights advocates say remains a worrying problem, contributing to estimated annual profits in Asia of US$10 billion (S$12.9 billion).\n\nIn 2012, the police conducted 3,567 anti-commercial sex operations which led to the arrest of 203 commercial sex agents or ""pimps"", up from the 2,643 operations and 148 arrests made the year before.\n\nThose arrested are investigated, and action is taken against them if necessary, said the Singapore Inter- agency Taskforce on Trafficking in Persons (TIP) in an exclusive e-mail interview with The Sunday Times.\n\nEarlier last week, it issued a stinging rebuttal of this year's United States report on human trafficking, which charged, again, that Singapore has not done enough to address trafficking.\n\nThe report is produced annually by the US Department of State and is based on the extent of countries' efforts to comply with the ""minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking"" found in US Laws on Trafficking in Persons (see http:// www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt).\n\nFor the third year, it placed Singapore in Tier 2 of a four-tier category system as a country not fully compliant with minimum international standards against human trafficking but making ""significant efforts"" in the area.\n\nThe report alleged, among other things, that child sex trafficking occurs in Singapore, and that the Singapore Government investigated more than 400 leads, ""yet it only substantiated 21 trafficking cases during the year"".\n\nThe TIP, which was set up in 2010 and is co-chaired by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Manpower, said the US report was riddled with ""inaccuracies and misrepresentations"", and that Singapore has, in fact, been committed to fighting trafficking.\n\nApart from the anti-commercial sex operations, the police also handled 52 sex trafficking reports, and identified 72 cases with elements of labour trafficking last year, up from the 43 reports and 67 cases respectively in 2011.\n\nElements of labour trafficking include employment-related disputes such as insufficient payments of salary, failure to pay salary and, in some cases, employees having to work long hours with insufficient rest.\n\nThe growth in enforcement efforts is a result of TIP having ""stepped up training for enforcement officers to equip them with skills and knowledge that will help them identify potential trafficking victims early"", said a TIP spokesman.\n\n""We are also raising public awareness on trafficking in persons among the general public via public education campaigns that may help increase the detection of cases through increased reporting in the long term.""\n\nDr Alistair Cook, an adjunct research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies' Centre for Non-Traditional Security Studies, said the figures indicated TIP was implementing greater measures to address the issue of human trafficking.\n\n""Singapore is primarily a destination for traffickers and victims largely in sex trafficking, but also in cases of labour trafficking, where it could be construed as labour exploitation, and then retrafficked into sexual exploitation,"" he added, noting he had not seen evidence of a significant change in the number of human trafficking cases, partly because it is such an informal economy.\n\nHe suggested Singapore create an ""index of trafficking"" with a clear list of indicators so people can better help identify and alert authorities to suspected trafficking.\n\nSingapore is a natural destination for traffickers and recruiters to coerce the vulnerable who fall prey to human trafficking, as there is constant demand for foreign workers, said Ms Sylvia Lee, the founder of anti-trafficking volunteer organisation EmancipAsia.\n\nMs Lee praised the TIP's intensified crackdown on trafficking, but said more could be done, including tightening immigration control over single girls and women from certain countries coming to Singapore.\n\nhpeishan@sph.com.sg",Incident,article
