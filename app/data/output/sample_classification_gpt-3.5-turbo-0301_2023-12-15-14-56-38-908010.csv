5e8227610dc171d3c93e7449,"NEW DELHI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Women and children who have survived deadly floods in India could now be at risk of being sold as brides or into domestic and sex work by traffickers preying on vulnerable families, aid agencies say.\n\nSoldiers rescue stranded people after heavy rains in Uttarakhand June 18, 2013. REUTERS/Stringer/Files\n\nThe floods and landslides, triggered by heavier than normal monsoon rains more than two weeks ago, have killed more than 580 people in Uttarakhand, a popular Hindu pilgrimage destination. At least 3,000 people remain missing.\n\nAid workers and government officials, struggling to negotiate roads blocked by landslides to get to remote mountain villages, say tens of thousands of people have been hit by the disaster.\n\nIn the worst-hit districts of Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi, homes, crops and livestock have been washed away by the deluge and hundreds of roads, bridges and buildings are in need of reconstruction.\n\n‚ÄúPeople have lost everything. Their homes and livelihoods have been ruined. Many people who were earning incomes from the religious tourism industry such as in the hotels, shops, restaurants and as porters, will have no jobs now,‚Äù Debrabrat Patra, Action Aid‚Äôs regional manager, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Badrinath, part of the disaster zone.\n\n‚ÄúTrafficking of young girls happens here due to poverty, and families are often coerced into accepting money from traffickers who marry their daughters to older men in other states, rather than pay a large dowry for them. After the floods, this is likely to worsen as people are poorer and more desperate.‚Äù\n\nSouth Asia, with India at its centre, is the fastest-growing and second-largest region for human trafficking in the world, after East Asia, according to the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC).\n\nOver 150,000 people are known to be trafficked within South Asia every year, but the trade is conducted underground and the real number is likely to be much higher.\n\nThousands of young girls are trafficked in India alone, including many from Nepal and Bangladesh, and sold into forced marriage, bonded work as a prostitute or as a maid or paid for their organs.\n\nSave the Children India said that children - both boys and girls - were most at risk.\n\n‚ÄúIn these kinds of emergencies, children are the most vulnerable and trafficking is a serious issue. Children can easily be exploited in the hopelessness, poverty and chaos that follow a disaster,‚Äù said Save the Children‚Äôs Devendra Tak, adding that it was essential to create ‚Äúchild-friendly spaces‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúTheir homes are destroyed, their schools are either damaged or being used as relief camps.

5e8229ad0dc171d3c93e75bb,"The Eastern Corridor of the Northern Region, particularly areas around Zabzugu and Tatale, is fast becoming a transit point for human trafficking activities.\nAccording to statistics made available by the Domestic Violence and Victims Support Unit (DOVVSU) of the Ghana Police Service, 18 people aged between four and 19 were trafficked to neighbouring countries such as Mali, Togo and Nigeria by a syndicate operating in the area in 2012 alone.\nIn 2010, two cases were recorded in the Walewale area.\nHowever, due to intensive surveillance being mounted by the police and other stakeholders, it appears the activities of the group are being frustrated.\nCommunities along the Eastern Corridor¬† include Saboba, Chereponi, Yendi, Gushiegu, Salaga and Nanumba South and North districts.\nThe DOVVSU, with support from the Department of Social Welfare and Recfam, a local non-governmental organisation, has been able to reintegrate 30 children who were previously trafficked along the Zabzugu/Tatale area into their respective families and communities.\nAs a result of the intensive surveillance to stem the tide, two suspects who were allegedly involved in human trafficking at Tatale under the pretext of offering their victims jobs in Nigeria were arrested by the Northern Regional Police Command on June 19, 2013.\nIssah Yakubu, 26, and Abdul Karim Habib, 29, were said to have so far trafficked 18 Ghanaians, mainly children, to Nigeria.\nTheir modus operandi is to persuade their victims into believing that when they are sent to Nigeria they will be offered jobs which could enable them to buy motorbikes within a relatively short time.\nThe Regional Crime Officer, Superintendent of Police Alhaji Arhin Mahama, told The Mirror in Tamale that the police, upon a tip-off, mounted surveillance on the suspects.\nHe explained that Yakubu and Habib, in their latest operation, had completed arrangements and succeeded in trafficking three Ghanaians to Nigeria before they were arrested by the police.\nThe names of two of the victims were given as Seidu Yahaya and one Osman but the name of the third victim is yet to be known.\nThe officer said when Yakubu and Habib were questioned, they admitted committing the offence and added that they had an accomplice called Annan who traffics the victims¬† to Nigeria.\nYakubu and Habib, according to Alhaji Mahama, gave the phone number of the accomplice to the police who in turn called the number and spoke to the victims.\nThey (the victims) allegedly lamented about the deplorable situation they found themselves in Nigeria.\nThe Mirror also gathered that in recent times human trafficking in Tatale is increasing partly because the area is close to the Togo border.\nThe United Nations Children?s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimate that between 200,000 and 300,000 children are trafficked each year for forced labour and sexual exploitation in West and Central Africa.\nIt has been observed that the figures might be higher, since there is no reliable data due to various reasons such as the underground and illegal nature of human trafficking, the lack of anti-trafficking legislation in some African countries and the reluctance of the victims to report their experiences to the authorities.\nAccording to the Regional Coordinator of DOVVSU, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Emmanuel Holortu, parental neglect, inability of parents to control their children, poverty and broken homes are some of the major causes of human trafficking along the corridor.\nHe said most of the victims, who were mainly children, fell prey to those engaged in that criminal act partly because their parents were divorced and had entered into new relationships, hence they were exposed as there was no care for them.\nHe further revealed that in the case of a particular four-year-old boy who was trafficked to Mali, his own father gave him out to the traffickers.\nThe DOVVSU Regional Coordinator once again observed that these victims, particularly the girls, suffer from all forms of abuse, including the fact that some of them are used as sex slaves or for prostitution while their male counterparts are engaged in menial jobs.\nASP Holortu was of the view that there must be effective monitoring and surveillance to clamp down on the activities of the syndicate, noting that a lot of activities had been put in place in collaboration with non-governmental organisations to nip the practice in the bud.\nSource: The Mirror",Incident,Article
