## Environment Set-up

1. Create an environment using python venv called 'model_recommender'. Open your terminal or command prompt to run:
```
# For Unix/macOS
python3.10 -m venv model_recommender

# For Windows
python3.10 -m venv model_recommender
```

2. Activate the Virtual Environment

Before installing any packages, activate the virtual environment:
```
# For Unix/macOS
source model_recommender/bin/activate

# For Windows
model_recommender\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the packages on the new environment. Navigate to the 'backend' folder if you are not there already. Then run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
